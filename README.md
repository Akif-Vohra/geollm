# GeoLLM 

I like looking up Geography/History/Maps. I created this app to ask questions 
to LLM and generate a map in return. Frontend and Backend are separate so 
just calling an API endpoint should also work.

# Frontend

I am a bit rusty with frontend, but I decided to go with vite and alpine after
some initial reading on the latest JS ecosystem. I think the frontend would 
remain minimal and not very complex. With alpine.js I get the required DOM 
bindings and reactive states without a lot of overhead. If I think of more
features in the future, maybe I would consider React?

Following should be enable to get the frontend running.

    npm install
    npm run dev

# Backend

Still to do. I am thinking of going with Flask. TBD.
